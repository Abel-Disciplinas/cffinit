- Peter is a developer who contributed to an existing project and now wants to also be recognized as an author of the software. The software already has a CITATION.cff file. He wants to be able to load the CITATION.cff information somehow, and then just add his own details and be done.
- Bouwe is a developer for a software package that has many contributors. His project does not yet have a CITATION.cff file. He wants to automatically populate the CITATION.cff file with the information about whoever is listed as a contributor on his repository.
- Stefano is a developer for a software package that has many contributors. His project does not yet have a CITATION.cff file but has been published on Zenodo. He wants to automatically populate the CITATION.cff file with the information associated with the DOI.

- policy maker wants people to use cffinit
- publisher wants paper authors to accurately describe which software was used for creating the results discussed in a given paper
- publisher of a software journal wants to easily populate a form given a github url
- publisher wants to maximize the value of a given paper. Papers that are reproducible because they accurately cite what software was used for a paper, a re more valuable.
- funders want to ensure the funding helps others. For a paper that depends on software for its results, that means you have to be able to accurately cite the software used to produce the results produced in the paper
- reviewer wants to reproduce the work under review but they can't find what software was used.

- Maria wants to point other people to the cffinit website, but will only do so if she's confident that the website will give the users a good experience
